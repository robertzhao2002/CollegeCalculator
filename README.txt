The final percentage is calculated by 45% GPA + SAT, 15% based on the actual acceptance rate on Google, 15% based on your Race/Ethnicity,
10% Gender, 10% Pure Luck (Accounts for Essays, EC, Teacher Recommendations), 5% First Generation, and 5% Alumni.

GPA+SAT Percentages
The GPA+SAT Percentages were from niche.com; my unweighted GPA was a 3.88 and my SAT was a 1550. The percentage means the proportion of 
people lower than me for that school (some selective schools' GPA percentile are affected by the major; if the GPA distribution is 
significantly different for 'All Majors' vs. 'Specified Major', I adjusted the percentage manually; for my case Computer Science
was my major).

Race/Ethnicity Value (Go by the ethnicity of your last name):
- 20% for Asians
- 30% for White
- 50% for African-American/Hispanic

Gender value:
- 40% for males
- 60% for females

Pure Luck:
I generated a random number between 1 and 5 (5 not included) and found the reciprocal of the number. The values range from 0.2 to 1.
This changes every time you run the program and every college's value will be different.

First Generation:
- 40% for Non-First Generation
- 60% for First Generation

Alumni:
- 45% for no alumni in your family
- 55% for alumni in your family
